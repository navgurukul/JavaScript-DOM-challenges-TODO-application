### Daily Structure (Max 2 Hours Each)
Each day includes:
- **Concepts**: Core topics with simple bullet-point guidance
- **Understanding**: Easy-to-grasp explanations and real-world use cases
- **Examples**: Step-by-step code demonstrations with MDN references
- **Interview Questions**: Common technical questions with clear answers
- **Practical Project**: Progressive TODO app development (30-45 minutes)
- **Resources**: Curated links for self-paced deeper exploration

### Project: Personal Task Manager (TODO Application)
A single, evolving project that progressively implements concepts:
- **Days 1-2**: Foundation setup and basic DOM understanding
- **Days 3-4**: Element manipulation and dynamic content
- **Days 5-6**: User interactions and form handling
- **Days 7-8**: Advanced events and data management
- **Days 9-10**: Modern practices and React preparation
