# 10-Day JavaScript DOM Curriculum for React Prerequisites
## BCA Third Semester - Personal Task Manager TODO Application

### Course Overview
This curriculum provides a structured 10-day learning path for JavaScript DOM manipulation, specifically designed to prepare BCA students for React development. Each day focuses on 2 hours of hands-on learning through a progressive TODO application project.

### Learning Objectives
- Master fundamental DOM concepts and manipulation techniques
- Understand event handling and user interactions
- Learn modern JavaScript practices essential for React
- Build practical experience through incremental project development
- Prepare for React's component-based thinking

### Daily Structure
Each day includes:
- **Concepts**: Core topics with bullet-point guidance
- **Understanding**: Practical explanations and use cases
- **Examples**: Code demonstrations and MDN references
- **Interview Questions**: Common technical questions
- **Practical Project**: Progressive TODO app development
- **Resources**: Curated links for deeper exploration

### Project: Personal Task Manager (TODO Application)
A single, evolving project that progressively implements DOM concepts:
- Day 1-2: Basic structure and DOM understanding
- Day 3-4: Element creation and manipulation
- Day 5-6: Event handling and user interactions
- Day 7-8: Dynamic content and data management
- Day 9-10: Advanced features and optimization
